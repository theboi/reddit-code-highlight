A Google Chrome extension (Sorry Safari) to highlight code found on reddit.com.

## Installation

- Download this repository from GitHub at https://github.com/theboi/reddit-code-highlight.
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` (Paste in URL search bar).
- Toggle `Developer mode` on (top right corner).
- Click `Load Unpacked` and locate the the repository you just downloaded.
- Why? Because I am too broke to pay Google for a Chrome Web Store developer account (sorry :sweat::sob:).
